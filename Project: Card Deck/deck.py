Programming Project 4--Deck Class

The Deck class represents a stadard deck of playing cards with or without two jokers.
The card files for the graphic of each card are in a folder named cards. Each card
file is named with its rank and a letter for its suit. For example, the 4 of hearts
is in the file 4h.gif while the jack of clubs is in the file 11c.gif. Aces will have
rank 1 and kings rank 13. 

Document Assistance (who and what or declare no assistance):
Professor Mueller helped me to finish the deck class by explaining steps to do the function moveToDealNext
